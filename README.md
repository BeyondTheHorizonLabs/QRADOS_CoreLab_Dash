# QRADOS CoreLab Dash

## Description

now  This project serves as an **advanced Triangle Anomaly Scanner**, leveraging **state-of-the-art electromagnetic, RF, and geomagnetic field sensors** to capture disturbances that could indicate unknown phenomena.

Unlike traditional investigation tools, QRADOS utilizes **AI-powered real-time data correlation, spectral analysis, and frequency anomaly detection** to provide unprecedented insights into environmental shifts, potential non-terrestrial signals, and unexplained aerial phenomena. With its **scalable modular design**, QRADOS CoreLab Dash supports both **indoor and outdoor investigations**, making it a powerful tool for **scientific expeditions, UAP research teams, and advanced paranormal fieldwork**.

## Features

- 🌎 **Ground-Based Multi-Sensor Integration:** Captures and analyzes **electromagnetic fluctuations, RF disturbances, and environmental data**.
- 📡 **Live Data Feeds:** Streams **real-time telemetry** from QRADOS sensor arrays, allowing for **on-the-fly anomaly detection**.
- 🔬 **AI-Driven Anomaly Detection:** Detects **unexplained energy shifts, signal interferences, and localized frequency anomalies**.
- 🚀 **Modular Expansion:** Designed for **indoor & outdoor deployment, structured field testing, and research missions**.
- 🔄 **WebSocket Integration:** Enables **continuous data streaming and remote visualization**.
- ☁ **Cloud & Local Storage:** Compatible with **PostgreSQL, JSON-based logs, and encrypted cloud storage for historical research**.
- 🖥 **Docker-Ready Deployment:** Fully containerized for **scalable and cross-platform usage**.

## Why This Device is a Breakthrough for Paranormal & UAP Research

🔹 Unlike **standard EMF meters**, QRADOS **correlates multiple sensor inputs**, reducing **false positives** and increasing accuracy in anomaly detection.
🔹 Uses **triangulated data points** from multiple QRADOS units to identify **localized anomalies** with precision.
🔹 Supports **UAP spectral frequency analysis**, potentially detecting **encoded signals or unknown energy sources**.
🔹 AI-driven **pattern recognition** to differentiate between **natural phenomena and unexplained occurrences**.
